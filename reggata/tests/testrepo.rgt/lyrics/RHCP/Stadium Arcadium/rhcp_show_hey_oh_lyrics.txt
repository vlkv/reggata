RHCP - Snow (Hey Oh)

Come to decide that the things that I tried Were in my life just to get high on When I sit alone come get a little known But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky And I do believe it, we rely on When I lay it on come get to play it on All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh, listen what I say oh, I got your Hey oh, now listen what I say oh
When will I know that I really can't go To the well once more time to decide on When it's killing me, when will I really see All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave Before I get my chance to ride When it's killing me, what do I really need? All that I need to look inside
Hey oh, listen what I say oh, come back and Hey oh, look at what I say oh
The more I see the less I know The more I like to let it go Hey oh, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder And it's so white as snow Running through the field Where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go, ho!
When to descend to amend for a friend All the channels that have broken down Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky And I do believe what we rely on When I lay it on, come get to play it on All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh, listen what I say oh, I got your Hey oh, listen what I say oh
The more I see the less I know The more I'd like to let it go Hey oh, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Running through the field Where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go
I said hey hey yeah, oh yeah Tell my love now Hey hey yeah, oh yeah Tell my love now
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Privately divided by a world so undecided And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder Where it's so white as snow Running through the field Where all my tracks will be concealed And there's nowhere to go
I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah Tell my love now Hey hey yeah, oh yeah
