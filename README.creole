== About Reggata

Reggata is a tagging system for managing local files on your computer.
More detailed description of Reggata features and the principles of how it works can be found on 
wiki pages [[https://github.com/vlkv/reggata/wiki]]. 
Also, there is a nice review of Reggata features available here [[http://reggata.findmysoft.com]].

This is a very "young" project and I'm very interested about your opinion on it. Your comments and 
suggestions are very appreciated. Feel free to email me (vitvlkv@gmail.com).

If you found a bug or maybe want to request a new feature then report it here [[https://github.com/vlkv/reggata/issues]].

This project is not supported anymore, because I'm developing another version of it https://github.com/vlkv/reggatad.
